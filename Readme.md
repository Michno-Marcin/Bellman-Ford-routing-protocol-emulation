This project is implementation of Bellman-Ford routing protocol for networks in Matlab. 
In "A small example of routing tables.xlsx" you can see how routing table changes in successive iterations (routers data exchange).
To see how this protocol works, you can check "ExampleOfSmallNetworkChangesInRoutingTables.m" script and run consecutive lines containing any comments.
To see the result, you can just run "EffectofBellmanFordProtocolForLargeNetworks.m" script and check it for sample entered values.
